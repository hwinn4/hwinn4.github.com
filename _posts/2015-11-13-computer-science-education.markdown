This evening I attended an event called CS Education for Every Student: How Do We Get There? At the event, Flatiron founder Adam Enbar moderated a panel that discussed the city’s 10-year plan to bring computer science to every public school in NYC. The panel, peopled by Debbie Marcus, Executive Director of CS Education for the DOE, two educators, and a member of the ScriptEd team brought up many thoughtful perspectives. I was most struck by the following: 

* While it’s easy to criticize such a large and ambitious endeavor and focus on all the ways in which achieving this goal will be difficult, there are so many people who care about expanding and equalizing access to CS education. The community is full of positive and motivated individuals.
* Both engineers and pedagogues will need to be part of this effort in order for it to succeed (and, fortunately, so many are already getting involved).
* The NYC Software Engineering Pilot program, in which I taught for several years, already reaches many more students each year than the AP CS course, which prior to SEP was pretty much the only CS course offered in NYC public schools, if a school even offered a CS course at all.

What has made all of this progress possible thus far is, in part, the relentless growth mindset embraced by people who have ushered in this new era in CS education. DOE personnel and industry professionals alike have approached the mammoth goal of expanding CS opportunities with the belief that, if they try and make the effort, small victories will occur daily, monthly, yearly, etc., and beyond that the larger goal of reaching all public schools in the city is within sight. That spirit was palpable in the room during the panel and subsequent Q&A. 

During the event, an audience member asked the panel about the role of social justice in a CS curriculum, and the panel’s answers touched on the themes that underscore many people’s passion for participating in this movement: making CS accessible to students from underrepresented communities, supporting schools that struggle to provide on their own the resources necessary to foster a CS curriculum, and creating a school-to-career pipeline that will make it possible for the tech sector to reflect the diversity of peoples and perspectives that defines New York City. To me, social justice stands at the heart of the matter. Social justice should not only be a major motivating force for individuals and corporations to promote CS education, but social justice can also be the context in which students learn to code. A quick glance at [#PoweredbyHer](http://poweredbyher.com/), which showcase student CS projects, reveals that students want to create apps that promote safety, diversity, health, and equal access to opportunities.

I originally became a teacher because I wanted to work with students, advocate for them, and help them find their own voices; coding presents a nearly unparalleled opportunity for students to showcase their creativity and insights for the world to see. I look forward to figuring out how I, someone with the potential to stand at the intersection of pedagogy and technical skills, can play a role as CS education continues to evolve.
